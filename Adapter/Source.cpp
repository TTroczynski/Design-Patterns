	//For example:
	//a power adapter for different regions of the world.
	//different shape, voltage, frequency
	//
	//the issue is that you cant modify everything to suuport every type of interface
	//an interface being the API of the thing you are trying to implement

	//you need a special device (Adapter) that can give you the interface you require


	//for example:
	//you have a 220v power adapter 
	//but you need an adapter to give you 5v so that you can charge your phone


	//Adapter:

	//a construct that adapts an existing interface X to conform to the required interface Y
