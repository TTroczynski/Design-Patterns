//Facade:
// 
//exposing several components through a single interface
//

//Example:
//a house is a system which tries to balance complexity and presentation and useability.
//a typical home has many subsystems: electricity, plumbing, sanitation...
//complex structures: the flooring - its multilayered, sectional
//end user is not exposed to the internals
//same with software
//Many systems working to provide felxibility but...API consumers want it to 'just work'

//The facade design pattern.. provides a simple, easy to understand/user interface over a large and sophisticated body of code



//Need a more complicated example to create a facade for.
//a Facade creates an interface for several systems/classes/objects that is a simple to use
